                City Sightseeing, the world's leading open-top bus brand, is relaunching its operations in Dubai from Thursday with its unique city tour featuring new, enhanced health and safety measures. The service also announced a limited-time offer for residents.
            <br><br>
            First launched in 2014 as a joint venture with the dnata Travel Group, City Sightseeing Dubai has grown to become one of the city's most popular and recognisable tour options. It is known across more than 100 of the world's top destinations for its fun-filled, iconic red open-top buses and "hop-on, hop-off" concept, offering the chance to explore a city's top sights and attractions with an informative audio guide.
            <br><br>
            As domestic tourism continues to witness an increase in traffic, the City Sightseeing team is announcing a new offer for residents to rediscover Dubai with up to 50 per cent discount on the standard fare for a limited time.
            <br><br>
            Alaa AlKhatib, VP Destination Management, dnata Travel Group, commented, "We are delighted to announce that City Sightseeing Dubai is relaunching today offering UAE residents and tourists alike the chance to join us back on-board safely.
            <br><br>
            "Domestic tourists can find themselves on a quest to discover how well they know the city, and to mark the occasion, we are launching an introductory offer where UAE residents can purchase 2-for-1 tickets, for the chance to rediscover Dubai or explore for the first time some of its most extraordinary areas and landmarks, or share them to visiting friends and family."
